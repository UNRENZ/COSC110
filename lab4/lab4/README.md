# Lab 4 - Exploring Calculus with SymPy

## Description
This lab uses SymPy to explore basic calculus concepts like limits, derivatives, series expansions, and equation solving symbolically.

## Key Activities
- Explored symbolic operations with variables (e.g., x + x, x * x)
- Calculated limits (e.g., limit of sin(x)/x as x → 0)
- Found derivatives (e.g., derivative of x²)
- Generated series expansions of functions (e.g., exponential function)
- Solved quadratic equations symbolically

## Tools
- Python
- SymPy

## Reflection
- Learned how computers can solve and simplify calculus problems symbolically
- Discovered the power of symbolic math in Python
